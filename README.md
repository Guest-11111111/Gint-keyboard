# Gint-keyboard
Dear classpad users,
    Gint was made for other calculators. They have a keyboard, we _don't_ have one. Now, we do.

Simply pull the keyboards into the root of the calc.
Then use: 
    from _keyboard_.py import *

## v1.1.0-alpha
     only QWERTY keyboard graphics no interaction, yet...
